COLOMBO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The glorious days where he plied on Colombo roads
escorted by hundreds of elite Commandos were over. General Sarath Fonseka, the
right-hand man of Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa for over three years
in their sole mission -- destroying Tamil Tiger rebels -- has now become a
strong enemy of the government.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the life is not so rosy for Sri Lanka's first four- star general after
he lost the presidential election on Jan. 26 this year by about 1.8 million
votes.
</P>
<P>
His sudden twist to shed the Army uniform that he wore for over 40 years and
wear white national suit to challenge the incumbent president took him a tough
and rough ride. Today, he is caged and isolated in a naval base in Colombo with
a serious charge of planning a military coup while in uniform and is to stand
before a court-martial soon.
</P>
<P>
To many Sri Lankans "General Sarath Fonseka" is still a hero. But for the
government, its one time hero is now a traitor after his explosive revelation to
the media on Army killing some rebel leaders coming with white flags to
surrender during the last stages of the final battle in May 2009.
</P>
<P>
The UN and human rights groups all over the world were up in arms accusing the
government of war crimes. While the government strongly denied the accusation,
Fonseka too claimed that he was misquoted by the paper.
</P>
<P>
Becoming more aggressive during the run-up to the presidential polls he
threatened to imprison the Rajapaksas including the president and his brother
Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who fought against the rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE) together with Fonseka, if he comes to power.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic move the military arrested him on Feb. 8 while he was discussing
with some leaders of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition political parties opposed the government's move and have started
signing a petition and staging protests to seek his immediate release.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the government of keeping him in custody without any
charge, but the defense secretary said Fonseka was arrested for using his
official positions in the Army to get in touch with political parties with the
view of entering into politics.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Fonseka was arrested, 15 high ranking Army officers considered to be
his supporters were sent on compulsory retirement.
</P>
<P>
After questioning over 35 persons including over 20 military people, the Army
finalized gathering evidence last week.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya, President Rajapaksa,
who is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces appointed two court-martial on
Thursday to try Fonseka.
</P>
<P>
Equally credited with President Rajapaksa for ending the island 's 30-year long
bloody civil war, 59-year-old Fonseka is to be tried before three-member bench
on March 16 and March 17 under the Army Act at the Navy Headauaters.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Prasad Samarasinghe said two separate sets of charges had
been framed against him under the Army Act for engaging in politics while
serving in the Army and violating Army regulations when procuring weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said the bench will comprise three Major Generals -- H. L. Weeratunga
(Chairman), A. C. R. Wijetunga and D. R. A. Jayatillka while Rear Admiral W. W.
J. S. Fernando being the Judge Advocate in the trial.
</P>
<P>
Fonseka will be charged for violating the Section 124 and 102 ( 1) of the Army
Act for engaging in politics while serving as the Army Commander and later as
the CDS and also violating tender procedures under Section 109 (E).
</P>
<P>
Samarasinghe said the proceedings would be recorded and videoed to maintain
transparency.
</P>
<P>
"But it is not open to public or media," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Fonseka will be allowed to get the assistance of a defense lawyer of his choice
and also have the freedom to challenge the court- martial decision in the Court
of Appeal and then the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Alliance (DNA) led by Fonseka has decided to
fill a case in the Colombo High Court soon challenging the government's decision
to court-martial Fonseka.
</P>
<P>
DNA Secretary Vijitha Herath said they oppose Fonseka being questioned before a
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
"Our party lawyers instructed us that this decision was illegal as he is no
longer a military man," Herath said.
</P>
<P>
Herath also said as he was the senior most military officer of the country and
the junior officer could not be in the bench. " There is no senior officers to
question him in Sri Lanka and he can not be tried under the Army Act," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fonseka contested the presidency with the support of the island 's opposition
parties including the main opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition alliance broke up soon after the presidential election
and Fonseka will contest the forthcoming parliamentary election from Colombo on
the ticket of the DNA with the leftist party JVP of the People's Liberation
Front being its main party.
</P>
<P>
His wife Anoma Fonseka who is campaigning for him in the run-up to the election
said she would carry out her husband's work despite all attempts by the
government to stop the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the government, hoping to get a two-thirds majority in the new
parliament, must handle the trial of Fonseka very carefully since it may affect
the outcome of the election.
